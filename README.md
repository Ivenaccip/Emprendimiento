A different form to study is necessary for the new view of our world. Meanwhile, the world changes exponentially, the education in 
México down drastically. The repercussion of the games in the last years is changing the perception of social media and the style of 
learning. Not only the lack of education is the problem in México, the absence of technology is also another issue in this country. 
Fortunately, we have a solution to this trouble too. We looked that different games give news experiences or items for the people that pay.
The idea is to give this service and buy tokens and cryptocurrencies with the money collected. An IA will study when it should buy and 
sell the cryptocurrencies. The final money of the dealings will use to buy technology for the nongovernmental school and the indigenous 
community.
